## About Me

<p>
I am Hwidong Kim, a first-year M.S. student at <a href="https://kaist.ac.kr/kr/">KAIST</a>, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tkkim/">Prof. Tae-Kyun (T-K) Kim</a>.
</p>
<p>
My research interests revolve around generating and manipulating various 2D or 3D visual contents. Recently, I have been focusing on understanding and simulating 3D human-object interactions (HOI) by leveraging rich diffusion priors.
